title: 100% Game Completion
date: 2022-10-08

I am an avid gamer. I am also a completionist (for video games at least). When it comes to a game I truly enjoy, I can't think of a better way to show
my appreciation than to complete everything the developer wants me to complete.

Of course, there are some games where getting 100% is a bit challenging or may not be worth the effort (despite the game being really good).

Here's a list of my current 100%s:

- Apex Legends (FPS Battle Royale)
- Citizen Sleeper (Narrative RPG)
- Control (Third-person Action Adventure)
- Cyberpunk 2077 (FPS Action RPG)
- Death's Door (Isometric Action Adventure)
- Destiny 2 (MMOFPS)
- ELDEN RING (Third-person Open-world Action RPG)
- Ghostrunner (First-person Action Platformer)
- GRIS (Narrative-driven Platform Adventure)
- Hades (Roguelike Dungeon Crawler)
- Metal: Hellsinger (FPS Rhythm Game)
- STAR WARS Jedi: Fallen Order (Third-person Action Adventure)
- Stray (Third-person Cat-venture Game)

And here's a list of games where I'm nearly at 100%, but the remaining achievements are quite a hassle to obtain:

- Neon White (FPS Puzzle Platformer)
  - The last 2 achievements require me to complete the full game without dying. Easier said than done. Of course, given enough time, I could complete this. Alas, I don't have the time.
- Going Under (Satirical Roguelike Dungeon Crawler)
  - The last achievement I need requires me to defeat the Impostor's final test. Impostor mode is notoriously difficult, so I have yet to finish it.
- Everhood (Rhythm Adventure)
  - Most of the remaining achievements require me to **NO-HIT** the corresponding boss. I have done most of them already, but the one boss I feel like I cannot do is 'Incinerator (Part 2)'. There are 3 RNG sections that require a really fast reaction time. Ouch.
- BPM: BULLETS PER MINUTE (FPS Rhythm Game)
  - The last 3 achievements require me to beat the game with Sanngrior on the highest difficulty. With this character, if I get hit once, I'm dead. Now, I have already beaten the game on Hard with Odr, another hitless character. HOWEVER, Odr has the ability to fly, whereas Sanngrior does not.
- DOOM Eternal (FPS)
  - Some of my missing achievements require me to play Battlemode, an online PVP gamemode. Seeing as I do not want to play Battlemode, I doubt I will ever 100% this game.

In terms of games I currently play, I have just reinstalled Disco Elysium, and I am in the process of downloading Kena: Bridge of Spirits. Others games I frequent are
CS:GO, DOTA 2, and Monster Hunter Rise.

I will regularly update this list when I complete another game.

And also, there are plenty of other games that I have played that aren't on either list simply because I didn't go for all the achievements. That's not to say
those other games were bad (as an example, I have 100+ hours in Witcher 3, but I am nowhere near 100%), I just wasn't achievement-hunting at the time.
